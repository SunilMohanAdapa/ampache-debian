	The newest release of Ampache will prompt Admins to download and 
	install a config file if their current one is out of date. While
	ampache may work without the new config file, results may vary 
	it is strongly recommended that if prompted you install the newly
	created config file

	still meet all the requirements, and that your config file is up to
	date.
