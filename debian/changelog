   * Added support for lighttpd servers.  What this means is that the default
   behavior is for apache2 to be installed on new installs.  However if

     licensing of his work and is now releasing version 5.9.5 of the 
     XSPF JukeBox under the same BSD license that the original version of XSPF 
     Music Player was released under (XSPF JukeBox is based on XSPF Music 
     Player).  So now XSPF Music Player and XSPF JukeBox are now released under
     the same BSD type license.  This closes RC Bug #526719.  Closes: #526719
