ampache (3.5.4-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made package use a VirtualHost instead of adding alias symlink to 
    /etc/apache2/conf.d
  * Added /conf/ApacheAmpache.
  * Updated postinst and postrm to use a2ensite and a2dissite.
  * Updated ampache.install to install ApacheAmpache into 
    /etc/apache2/sites-available.
  * Removed "for" loop in debian/ampache.postinst debian/ampache.postrm.
    Thx pitti
  * Recreated /usr/share/ampache/www/modules/pearxmlrpc dir in debian/dir.
  * Made package depend on the correct php-xml-rpc package in debian/control.
    Moved eyed3 to the Suggests field, along with adding lame, faad, 
    mp3-splt, vorbis-tools to the Suggest field. LP: #681932 
  * Created the needed symlinks to php-xml-rpc in debian/links.
  * Corrected spacing in debian/ampache.preinst, added webserver reload,
    added comments.
  * Corrected spacing in ampache.postinst, changed from using webserver
    restart to using webserver reload, added comments.
  * Removed init_php_fix patch as it is no longer needed, refreshed patches.
  * Added discription headers to patch files.
  * debian/patches/xspf_notification.patch: If the user attempts to use the
    xspfflash player, the user will be pointed to 
    /usr/share/doc/ampache/README.Debian for details and a work around.
  * Included /config/mythbuntu_ampache.conf so webserver is configured
    correctly with Mythbuntu.
  * Reworked ampache.install, ampache.postinst and ampache.postrm for use on
    mythbuntu.
  * Reworked ampache.postinst and ampache.postrm so if the user chooses not to
    restart the webserver ampache will exit gracefully.
  * Setup dirs and permissions for logging in ampache.postinst and
    ampache.postrm, so all the user has to do is turn it on in ampache.cfg.php.
  * Added ampache.logrotate so if logging is turned on the logs will be
    rotated daily, and logs older than 7 days old will be deleted.
  * Added grab_xspf.sh to /usr/share/ampache/www/bin.  This is a simple bash
    script that grabs xspf_jukebox source and places xspf_jukebox.swf in
    /usr/share/ampache/www/modules/flash.  This gives the user an opt in
    choice to using the xspf flash player.
  * Updated debian/ampache.install to install grab_xspf.sh into 
    /usr/share/ampache/www/bin.
  * Updated Vcs fields to reflect new git repository.

ampache (3.5.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

   * Added support for lighttpd servers.  What this means is that the default
   behavior is for apache2 to be installed on new installs.  However if
