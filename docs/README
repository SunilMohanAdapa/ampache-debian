1. Intro:

  Ampache is a PHP-based interface to a MySQL database 
  where information about your audio files are stored.  The songs 
  are streamed using PHP; older versions required mod_mp3 but this
  version no longer does.  The songs are cataloged via PHP
  scripts.

  These tools are heavily dependent on quality tags in your audio
  files and or the file system organization. If you've kept them 
  up-to-date or organized this is the tool for you.  
  
  See CHANGELOG for version information.

3. Setting Up

  Ampache:
    If you're upgrading from 3.0 to 3.1 you will not be able to re-use
    your database or config.php files.  You will need to follow the entire 
    Ampache install guidelines oultined in the INSTALL file.  

3a. Upgrading Your Ampache Install

  If you are upgrading from an older version of Ampache we recommend
  moving the old directory out of the way, extracting the new copy in 
  its place and then re-creating the config file. All database updates
  will be handled by the /update.php script. There is no need to insert
  the /sql/ampache.sql if you have an existing installation.

  love ampache and want to encourage us to write more please

  to our cause. If you can't send beer a postcard would also
