  The person or persons who have associated work with this document
  (the "Dedicator" or "Certifier") hereby either (a) certifies that, to the best
  of his knowledge, the work of authorship identified is in the public domain of
  the country from which the work is published, or (b) hereby dedicates whatever
  copyright the dedicators holds in the work of authorship identified below
  (the "Work") to the public domain. A certifier, moreover, dedicates any
  copyright interest he may have in the associated work, and for these purposes,
  is described as a "dedicator" below.

  A certifier has taken reasonable steps to verify the copyright status of this
  work. Certifier recognizes that his good faith efforts may not shield him from
  liability if in fact the work certified is not in the public domain.

  Dedicator makes this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to
  the detriment of the Dedicator's heirs and successors. Dedicator intends this
  dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present
  and future rights under copyright law, whether vested or contingent, in the
  Work. Dedicator understands that such relinquishment of all rights includes
  the relinquishment of all rights to enforce (by lawsuit or otherwise) those
  copyrights in the Work.

  Dedicator recognizes that, once placed in the public domain, the Work may be
  freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, used, modified, built upon, or
  otherwise exploited by anyone for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,
  and in any way, including by methods that have not yet been invented or
  conceived.
